### What is Advent of Code?

A yearly advent calendar with one or more programming puzzles each day.

### My approach

1. I read the initial presented problem.
2. Then I think about how to solve the problem.
3. When I have figured out how I will approach it I start implementing in code.
4. Then I write a test with the inputs from the problem and asserting the result.
   1. If my implementation is correct I construct a `main` method and set everything up ready to take in the real input.
   2. If my implementation is not correct I add more debug logging if necessary and figure out what is wrong with the code.
5. I request the real input and copy it into the input file and run the `main` method.
6. I get the result and submit it.

### Refinement

Sometimes I am not pleased with my initial implementation and will refine or re-implement it entirely. If that is the case I include my original and refined solutions.

### Puzzles with multiple parts

The design choice for one part may not be compatible with the next part, so then I may choose to scrap sections or all I had implemented and go in a different direction.
